###
### stuff is a bit convoluted here, simply because the process isn't trivial
### To execute Vault tests, that submit stuff to L1 contracts, we need all the addresses (OVM_CTC, OVM_SCC).
### But for these contracts to be deployed, these contracts need Sequencer and Proposer addresses.
### So we start Vault and wait for it to be ready (the grep thingy in entrypoint)
### We continue with wallet, account and policy creation and setup. And write them to a file tokens_and_accounts.sh.
### The deployer mounts this volume and checks for the existence of this file and sources it when it comes up. This
### Exposes Sequencer and Deployer addresses as ENV vars in the deployer node.
### I guess this is OK for local docker-compose, but it certanly won't be OK for production Vault deploy.
### The Vault is a delicate thing.

services:
  ###
  ### deployer and batch_submitter are re-defined here
  ### because we need to override the default env vars
  ### that put in the sequencer and proposer private keys
  ### via SEQUENCER_PRIVATE_KEY - SEQUENCER_ADDRESS, PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY - PROPOSER_ADDRESS
  ### not very clean atm, because the modes exist side by side.

  ### we inject a short script that was prepared in Vault.
  ### It exposes Vault tokens, sequencer address and proposer address
  ### as env vars.
  ### PROPOSER_TOKEN, SEQUENCER_TOKEN, SEQUENCER_ADDRESS, PROPOSER_ADDRESS

  ### The deployer takes these addresses and populates the contracts guard with them.
  ### Batch submitter will go into Vault mode if these env vars are present.
