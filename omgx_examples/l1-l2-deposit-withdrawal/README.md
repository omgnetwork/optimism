# OMGX First Steps

## 1. To deploy on a LOCAL system

First, spin up a local system as usual:

```bash
$ cd optimism
$ yarn clean
$ yarn
$ yarn build
$ cd ops
```
Make sure you have the docker app running!

```
$ docker-compose down -v
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

Second, in this folder run:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn compile:ovm
```

This will compile the contract

```
$ hardhat compile --network optimism
Compiling 7 files with 0.7.6
